Ansible Concepts
Tasks, Modules, handlers, variables, includes, roles
Purpose of a play is to map a selection of hosts to tasks.
Playbook runs from top to bottom. It has tasks
Goal of each task is to execute a module, with very specific arguments. 
Variables can be used in arguments to modules.
The goal of a play is to map a group of hosts to some well defined roles, represented by things ansible calls tasks. 
Handlers are lists of tasks, not really any different from regular tasks, that are referenced by a globally unique name, and are notified by notifiers.
Roles are ways of automatically loading certain vars_files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure
Roles are just automation around ‘include’ directives

roles folder -> tomcat-install ---> files, handlers, tasks, tempaltes
