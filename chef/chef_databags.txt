DATA-BAGS:
	A data bag can be created in two ways: using knife or manually. In general, using knife to create data bags is recommended, but as long as the data bag folders and data bag item JSON files are created correctly, either method is safe and effective.
---------

cookbook for databag example is :: useradd

knife data bag create users

<Assuming I am in chef-repo directory>

mkdir data_bags
cd data_bags
mkdir users
cd users
vi rama.json
	{
		"id" : "rama",
		"gid" : 500
	}
:wq

knife data bag from file users rama.json

Add useradd recipe to the node

knife node run_list add node1 recipe['useradd::userdata']

Got client and run "chef-client"

knife search users "id:*"
knife search users "*:*"

knife data bag edit users rama

knife data bag remove users
